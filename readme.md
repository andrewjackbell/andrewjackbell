## About

I am a postgraduate computer science student, specialising in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Currently I study MSc Computer Science at the University of Warwick, and hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath.

I am interested in computational linguistics, NLG, computer vision and more. 

## Projects

<u>Master's Thesis (Ongoing)</u>: **NLP for Pharmacovigilance**

[Computational Pathology](https://dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u5501145/cpath.pdf) **TP53 Mutation Status Prediction in Lung Adenocarcinoma**

* Applied multiple instane learning (MIL) to predict mutation status in LUAD histology images

[NLP Project](https://github.com/saltdrew/Sentiment-Analysis): **Sentiment Analysis (SemEval 2017 Task 4a)**

* Pre-processed data and extracted features (Tf-Idf and GloVe) from large twitter datasets 
* Experimented with linear machine learning (MaxEnt) and deep learning methods (LSTM, BERT), for sentiment classification
  
[UG Dissertation](https://dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~u5501145/Dissertation.pdf): **Word Level Language Identification on Code Switched Social Media Text (NLP)**

* Extracted code switched (mixed language) language data from Twitter to form a dataset.
* Implemented a character n-gram based language model to extract relevant information from the language data
* Used a number of linear classifiers in three different settings, two of which capture contextual information.
* Conducted  experiments for each model and classifier setting, the best of which achieved over 90% accuracy.

[Compilers](https://github.com/saltdrew/C--Interpreter) **Interpreter for a C-like language with Functional Programming Features**

* Built an interpreter for the language using test driven development. Correctness of the interpreter was verified at each stage. 
* Features such as functions as arguments, function composition and functions as return values were added
